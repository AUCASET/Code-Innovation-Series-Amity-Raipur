# TRAP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

**TRAP** is an app cum game purposed for educational domain. This app is designed for children between the age group 14-17 which will strengthen their basic computer understanding in topics like logic gate, mathematical significance in programming and many more to come in future update.
At the present moment, this prototype have two main topic first is the mathematical relation in time complexity in programming and the second is the logic gate (including AND, OR, XOR, NOR and many more to come) designed for kids.

This is the first prototype pushed as per the guideline of indubateIND and we are continuously working to bring more features and options in future updates.
