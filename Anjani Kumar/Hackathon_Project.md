The education system continues to face multiple challenges in terms of the quality and delivery of education. Tech-based solutions can bridge the gap in learning and streamline the education system.
A great way to ideate and create innovative ed-tech solutions is to host education focussed hackathons.
Here are a few Education-based hackathon ideas:

Raise classroom behavior issues in real-time

Develop a referral process platform that helps teachers to raise and escalate major behavior issues in the classroom in real-time.
The platform would work like a classroom management tool that will help teachers to share real-­time information on their student’s classroom behaviors with students, other teachers, parents, and administrators.
The system should record all assessments made by the teachers for future reference and annual evaluations.
